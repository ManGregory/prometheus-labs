Create arc diagram:
* Sources of data (where are metrics/logs/traces)
* Systems to gather data (proxies, agents, exporters)
* Systems to store/process (prometheus, loki, tempo, cloud monitor)
* Visualization and alerts (grafana, alert manager, cloud dashboards)
Option 3
Traditional infrastructure: several linux servers and windows sql server
It's needed to have centralized monitoring solution:
- load of servers 
- availability of services
- alerts in case of problems
